# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
#
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
# Use Heap Sort
# Ex1:
# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true
# Ex2:
# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false
