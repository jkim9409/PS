# https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/
# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
#
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
#
# Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
#
# Ex1:
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
#
# Ex2:
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
